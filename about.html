            <h2>Our History and Aim</h2>
            <p>Stay Home Festival is a first of its kind event that will change the face of
            concert-going as we know it. Group One Entertainment Inc. has promoted and produced
            hundreds of major live concerts and festivals over the last two decades.  We continue
            our tradition of high quality entertainment, only improved upon with the convenience of
            the "new way of concert-going".  For our initial offering, we want to reach an audience
            that includes fans of all genres of music, and appeals to every generation of listeners.
            This is why our team has brought in acts from all over the world for a jam-packed lineup.
            </p>

            <h2>Entertainment Philosophy</h2>
            <p>While we have always been committed to the most environmentally-friendly production and set-up standards
            possible, we are particularly pleased to be able to put on a major show that will produce
            virtually no carbon footprint and yet still bring joy to millions. In fact, we will be going even further with that set
            of ideals, and a portion of the proceeds from Stay Home Festival
            will be donated to many "green" charities.
            </p>

            <h2>Dynamic Experience Approach</h2>
            <p>As with any festival that Group One Entertainment is associated with, we strive for perfection.
            That is why we announce many headliners and themes of our shows many months in advance, while 
            continuing to search and negotiate even more talent to strengthen our line-ups. We always have 
            something up our sleeve! There will be many more big surprises and additions before the big weekend,
            So continue to check back in with our website frequently for updates.
